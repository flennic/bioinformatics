# Bioinformatics
Group 14 - Labs for 732A51 Bioinformatics (Semester 1, Period 2, 2018)

**Please stick to the following group rules. Thank you :)**

1. **Ask for help** if you need any (initiative comes from you).
2. **Attend all lab sessions**.
3. **Prepare before (!) the lab session** for your parts of each lab so that you can
ask the instructor all the questions that might come up later on.
4. Do the best you can to ensure that the solutions for the part you are responsible for are **correct and understandable** for the other group members.
5. Push your part for each lab to GitHub **independently and on time**.
6. More technical: Please use the **Google Style Guide for R code**. With 2 exceptions: a) variable names with underscore (e.g. my_variable instead of myVariable) are okay and b) use = instead of <- Link: https://google.github.io/styleguide/Rguide.xml
