# Assignment 1

**Task:**

- Run all the R code and reproduce the graphics (https://www.bioconductor.org/help/course-materials/2015/Uruguay2015/day3-gene.expression.html)
- Go carefully through the R code and explain in your words what each step does.

**Data import**

First, we import the data corresponding to the GEO accession number GSE20986 
using the `getGEOSuppFiles()` function. We obtain a .tar file ("GSE20986_RAW.tar").
After extracting its contents, we obtain 12 .CEL.gz files. Consequently, these 
12 files are unzipped and the results are put into the `data` directory. The 
resulting 12 files are .CEL files (cell intensity files).

These files contain microarray data created by Affymetrix DNA microarray image 
analysis software. Recall that each set of microarray data contains light intensity
values, where high intensity corresponds to expressed genes and small intensity
to genes that were not expressed.

All the data comes from humans (Homo sapiens), from four different tissues:
iris, retina, choroid and human umbilical vein. There are three .CEL files per
tissue.

**Creating phenodata**

Before we are able to read in the data from all 12 files, we create a list with
threee objects: The `Name` (for use in the resulting R object), the `FileName`
(for finding the corresponding .CEL file) and `Targets` which seems to be some
required meta data like the number of files. This list is then written as a .txt 
file. Finally, the function `read.affy()` from the `simpleaffy` package is called.
to actually create the data to be used in R. This function takes phenodata.txt
as input to be able to find the .CEL files. The resulting object `celfiles` is
of class `AffyBatch` and contains the microarray data.

**Simple boxplot**

Now, we create a visualization of 12 boxplots, one for every .CEL file, using
`celfiles` as input. For this, we use the `boxplot` function from the 
`BiocGenerics` package. Unfortunately, the x-axis labels are not readable. 
Therefore, we don't know which boxplots belong to which .CEL file. Therefore, 
we create an improved boxplot visualization in the next step.

Note: Although light intensity values do have a unit, it does not really matter
for the interpretation. All we can do with the values is make relative comparisons
within one experiment. Higher values correspond to expressed genes. It is not 
possible whatsoever, to make comparisons across experiments because the scale
can differ. Furthermore, the scale is usually transformed (e.g. with logs), so
that absolute interpretations make even less sense.

Interpretation: As we can see, the majority of the light intensity values are 
between 5 and 7. However, there are also some very large light intensity values
which correspond to strongly expressed genes. The intensity values in the 
inter-quartile range (the rectangle boxes in the plots) may correspond to 
genes that are only expressed to a small extent or even not at all.

```{r, echo = FALSE}
# ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Question 1
# ------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Data import ------------------------------------------------------------------

# Get the Data
# x = getGEOSuppFiles("GSE20986")
# x

# Untar and Unzip
# DONT ADD THE FILE TO GIT IT'S 60MB!
# untar("GSE20986/GSE20986_RAW.tar", exdir = "data")
# cels = list.files("data/", pattern = "[gz]")
# sapply(paste("data", cels, sep = "/"), gunzip)

# Creating phenodata -----------------------------------------------------------

# It's a matrix with two columns. Each row has the same entries in their cells,
# which is the filename. The first column is called 'Name' and the second one
# is called 'FileName'.
phenodata = matrix(rep(list.files("data", pattern = "[CEL]"), 2), ncol =2)

# class(phenodata) # "matrix"

phenodata <- as.data.frame(phenodata)
colnames(phenodata) <- c("Name", "FileName")
# Adding a new column with the target
phenodata$Targets <- c("iris", 
                       "retina", 
                       "retina", 
                       "iris", 
                       "retina", 
                       "iris", 
                       "choroid", 
                       "choroid", 
                       "choroid", 
                       "huvec", 
                       "huvec", 
                       "huvec")
# Writes the dataframe to a .txt file
write.table(phenodata, "data/phenodata.txt", quote = F, sep = "\t",
            row.names = F)

# Now the data is read again and a boxplot is created
celfiles <- simpleaffy::read.affy(covdesc = "phenodata.txt", path = "data")

# Simple box plot --------------------------------------------------------------

# Creates a boxplot for the log base 2 intensities including pm (perfect) and 
# mm (mismatch)
BiocGenerics::boxplot(celfiles)

```

**Improved boxplot**

We now create an improved box plot, in which the x-axis labels are readable.

Note: The colors do not have a special meaning. They do not e.g. correspond to a 
specific tissue. Instead, there are 8 color values which are used from left to 
right. After all 8 values have been used, the 1st color is used, then the 2nd 
color etc.

```{r}

# Improved box plot ------------------------------------------------------------

# Create "nice looking" color palettes. So this array actually has hex-color
# values inside.
cols = brewer.pal(8, "Set1")

# Help page: exprs, AffyBatch-method
# The columns are the different .CEL files and hold the data. It's a class re-
# presentation for the probe level data. The main component are the intensities
# from multiple arrays of the save CDF type.
eset <- affy::exprs(celfiles)
samples <- celfiles$Targets
# colnames(eset) # Print colnames

# The colnames are set to our targets
colnames(eset) <- samples

# The .CEL files and their content is being plotted. It's basically the same
# plot as before but this time with fancy colors
BiocGenerics::boxplot(celfiles, col = cols, las = 2)

```

**Cluster analysis (by tissue)**

We have extracted the expression matrix (1354896 rows, 12 columns) from the 
`celfiles` object. Each row corresponds to a light intensity that tells us to 
what extend a gene is expressed (?). There are 12 columns for cell intensity file.

Now, we compute a distance matrix for these 12 columns, using the 
`Chebyshev distance` as a metric. The `Chebyshev distance` gives us the maximum
difference between any pair of points in two vectors.

Subsequently, we conduct a hierarchical cluster analysis on this distance matrix
and plot the results in a cluster dendogram. Note that there are 12 leaf nodes
in the plotted dendogram, each node corresponding to one .CEL file. The labels
tell us which tissue the .CEL file belonged to. 

Note that HCA is done by a stepwise procedure. At each step, the two columns with
the smallest dissimilarity are merged. We can therefore e.g. say that the 
bottom right leaf nodes (retina and retina) had a quite small dissimilarity. 
Also e.g. the 5th and 6th leaf nodes from the left (choroid and choroid) had a
quite small dissimilarity. After all, we can conclude similarities between 
.CEL files of the same tissue are recognized. However, it is also clear that
similarities between different tissues are recognized (such as iris and choroid).

## Significantly Differentially Expressed Genes

We observe the following differentially expresses genes:

```{r, echo = FALSE}

significant_genes = unique(significant_genes)
significant_genes = significant_genes[!is.na(significant_genes)]
print(significant_genes)

```

## Explanation How They Are Found

A volcano plot prints significance against fold-change. A fold-change is a measurement between two variables and is used as a measurement between how much they changed during measurements. So if we put on those values on the y- and x-axis we will get a view of the statistical signifiance and the magnitude of the a change. This enables the viewers to quickly recognize not only significant, but also "strong influencing" genes.

Therefore we have the ```log2``` of the fold-change on the x-axis and the ```-log10``` of the p-value on the y-axis. Thus interesting data points are those which are far to the top (p-value) and far to the left or right (significant change in the fold-change). In this one we can observe another feature of the data expressed in color. Here it is the regulation of the data.

The datapoints (genes) we obtained are those which are far to the right and in the upper part of the volcano plot. We used the provided code filtering those and adding the names to them as the seperator. All obtained genes are genes which are upregulated.

## Assignment 4

**Task:**

- Try to find more information on the genes that are reported to be significantly differentially expressed. Report in your own words on what you find.
- Report all the Gene Ontology (GO) terms associated with each gene.
  - Are any of the GO terms common between genes?
  - If so do the common GO terms seem to be related to anything particular?
- Try to present GO analysis in an informative manner, if possible visualize.
