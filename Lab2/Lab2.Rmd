## Question 1.1

```{r A1Q1_start, include=FALSE, echo=FALSE}
source("732A51_BioinformaticsHT2018_Lab02_GenBankGetCode.R")
```


Starting from 33 DNA sequence of various species of casque-headed lizard (Basiliscus basiliscus), other 33 sequences of nucleotides have been generated. The sampling probabilities are the same of the real proportions of the original dataset.  
After the artificial DNA has been created, the base frequencies are compared in Table 1. As expected, the observed proportions of the generated data closely resamble the theoretical ones.

## Question 1.2

* Created one phylogenetic tree with 33 tips

* For each original DNA sequence of the 33 available, used the function `simSeq(.)` from package `phangorn` to simulate the sequences.

* Result: 33 phylogenetic tree, one for DNA sequence, each with 33 tips.

**2. Translate nucleotid sequences into protein sequences & report amino acid composition:**

```{r}

# 2. Translate nucleotid sequences into protein sequences & report amino acid comp.

# Create function to obtain amino acid percentages from DNAbin
get_aa_comp = function(DNAbin, relative = TRUE){
  
  # Data conversion to obtain amino distribution
  
  original_amino = ape::trans(DNAbin) # Convert DNAbin to AAbin (amino acids)
  original_amino = as.character(original_amino) # convert AAbin to char list
  original_amino = unlist(original_amino) # convert char list to char vector

  # Report amino acid composition
  
  if (relative == TRUE) {
    # Compute percentages
    metric = as.numeric(table(original_amino)) / length(original_amino)
    names(metric) = names(table(original_amino))
  } else {
    # Compute counts
    metric = as.numeric(table(original_amino))
    names(metric) = names(table(original_amino))
  }

  return(metric)
}

# Obtain percentages by amino acid precentages
Simulated_Sample = get_aa_comp(sim_sample)
Simulated_Tree = get_aa_comp(sim_tree)
Original = get_aa_comp(original)

# Original has an X at second to last position, we need to account for that
# According to docu of ape::trans, this is because of alignment gaps when 
# e.g. the sequence does not have full 3 proteins.
Simulated_Sample = c(Simulated_Sample, X = 0)
Simulated_Tree = c(Simulated_Tree, X = 0)
Original = Original[c(1:(length(Original)-2), length(Original), length(Original)-1)]

kableExtra::kable(data.frame(Name = c(seqinr::aaa(), "gaps"),
                        Original, 
                        Simulated_Sample,
                        Simulated_Tree),
             caption = "Amino Acid Composition (in \\%)", booktabs = T) %>%
  kableExtra::kable_styling(latex_options = "hold_position")
            
```

**3. Obtain number of stop codons in simulated sequences & compare to true seq:**

There are 1270 stop codons in the original sequence, 1298 stop codons in the
simulated sequence without and 1333 stop codons in the simulated sequence with  
trees.

```{r}

# 3. Obtain number of stop codons in simulated sequences & compare to true seq 

Simulated_Sample = get_aa_comp(sim_sample, relative = FALSE)
Simulated_Tree = get_aa_comp(sim_tree, relative = FALSE)
Original = get_aa_comp(original, relative = FALSE)

kableExtra::kable(t(data.frame(Original = Original["*"], 
               Simulated_Sample = Simulated_Sample["*"],
               Simulated_Tree = Simulated_Tree["*"])),
             caption = "Number of Stop Codons", booktabs = T) %>%
  kableExtra::kable_styling(latex_options = "hold_position")

```

## Question 2.2

**Expected Markov chain order:**

I would expect order of 2 (or more) for the original data sets because three 
nucleotids code for an amino-acid and since the amino-acids are not fully 
independent in the DNA. Note that the number of required free parameters increases
a lot from 2 to 3 (see below). The larger the number of parameters, the less
reliable the estimated probabilities for the transition matrix will be.

For the simulated data sets, I would expect order of 1 because here, the 
nucleotids are indeed random and should therefore be independent.

Number of free parameters required for order of 1:
$$4 * (4-1) = 12$$
Number of free parameters required for order of 2:
$$4^2 * (4^2-1) = 240$$

Number of free parameters required for order of 3:
$$4^3 * (4^3-1) = 4032$$

Actual number of nucleotids by dataset:

`> length(unlist(original))`

`[1] 65435`

`> length(unlist(sim_sample))`

`[1] 65435`

`> length(unlist(sim_tree))`

`[1] 66000`

**First**, we concatenate the sequences from the three data sets and remove any
characters that are not "a", "c", "g", "t". **Second**, we conduct a Chi-Square test
with the H0: Sequence is of 1st order. The H0 get's rejected for the original 
sequence (since p = 0) but not for the two sampled sequences (as p > 0.05). This
is what we expected: First order Markov chains for the randomly sampled sequence
but second or higher order Markov chains for the original sequence (in which 
dependency exists). 

```{r}

# ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Question 2.2
# ------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# 1. Concatenate the sequences from the three data sets and remove any
# characters that are not "a", "c", "g", "t"

original_seq = unlist(as.character(original)) # obtain character vector
original_seq = original_seq[original_seq %in% c("a", "c", "g", "t")] # a, c, g, t

sim_sample_seq = unlist(as.character(sim_sample)) # obtain character vector
sim_sample_seq = sim_sample_seq[sim_sample_seq %in% c("a", "c", "g", "t")] # a, c, g, t

sim_tree_seq = unlist(as.character(sim_tree)) # obtain character vector
sim_tree_seq = sim_tree_seq[sim_tree_seq %in% c("a", "c", "g", "t")] # a, c, g, t

# 2. Assess the order with Chi-Square test

# This test returns a list of the chi-squared value and the p-value. 
# If the p-value is greater than the given significance level, we cannot reject 
# the hypothesis that the sequence is of first order.

cat("Assess the order with Chi-Square test:\n")
cat("Original:\n"); assessOrder(original_seq); cat("\n-------------\n")
cat("Simulated_Sample:\n"); assessOrder(sim_sample_seq); cat("\n-------------\n")
cat("Simulated_Tree:\n"); assessOrder(sim_tree_seq); cat("\n-------------\n")

```

\  
\  

**Third**, we fit 1st order Markov chains for all three data sets. 
Note that we tried to fit a higher order Markov chain for the original 
data set (since this would be appropriate based on the Chi-Square-Test). 
However, the function fitHigherOrder from the markovchain package did not
produce correct transition matrices and we also did not find any other package
that could fit a higher order Markov chain correctly. Therefore, we also fit
a 1st order Markov chain for the original data set.

\  

```{r}
# 3. Fit markov chains

# 1st order markov chains for sampled data --------------------------------------

original_fit = markovchainFit(data = original_seq, confidencelevel = 0.95,
                              name = "Original")
original_fit$estimate; cat("\n-------------\n")

sim_sample_fit = markovchainFit(data = sim_sample_seq, confidencelevel = 0.95, 
                              name = "Simulated_Sample")
sim_sample_fit$estimate; cat("\n-------------\n")


sim_tree_fit = markovchainFit(data = sim_tree_seq, confidencelevel = 0.95, 
                              name = "Simulated_Tree")
sim_tree_fit$estimate


# Fitting higher order markov chains did not work
# original_fit_2nd = fitHigherOrder(original_seq, order = 2)
# cat("Original, 2nd order:\n\n"); original_fit_2nd; cat("\n-------------\n")

```

\  
\  

**Lastly**, we consider the assumptions behind the analyses (see book 
"Statistical Methods in Bioinformatics"):

1. *Markov property*: "current state is all that matters in determining the 
probabilities for the states that the process will occupy in the future.
2. *Temporally homogenous transition probabilities property*: given that at 
time t, the process is in state $E_{j}$, the probability that one time unit
later it is in state $E_{k}$ is independent of t.

We consider nucleotid sequences here. 

1. The *Markov property* may be violated, especially in the original sequence 
because the nucleotids code for amino-acids that will later on be translated into 
proteins. Therefore, one cannot actually assume that the previous nucleotids 
don't matter in determining the probabilities for the next states. 

2. Regarding the second property, we don't consider time here but space (i.e.
position of the nucleotids). From my point of view, it is a valid assumption 
that the position does not matter (however the type of the previous nucleotids 
does, see 1.).

## Question 2.3

1. Choose a distance measure between sequences.
2. Calculate for each alignment the distances between all pairs of sequences.
